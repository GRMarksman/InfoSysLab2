# InfoSysLab2

This is a project for the second lab course of Informational Systems

The task was to create a dockerfile that pulls the image of Ubunty 16.04, adds a python script and builds an image to create an executable container.
The container if deployed pulls weather info from api.openweathermap.org into a .json format.
